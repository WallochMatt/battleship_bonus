# battleship_bonus
Two-player console application simulating  the classic Battleship board game.

Create a two-player Battleship game that follows
the standard Battleship rules, so that two players can enjoy the turn-based game.

●Use a two-dimensional List to create a game 
board with a minimum space size of 10x10 for each player. 

●I want a player to place a destroyer (space size: 2), 
submarine (space size: 3), battleship (space size: 4), and aircraft carrier (space size: 5)
on the game board, and ensure the ships do not overlap, so that players have the 
ability to move their ships around as desired. 

●I want each player to have their ship locations hidden 
from the other player, so that the game is played fairly. 

●I want to present each player, on their turn, with a 
console print-out of the other player’s board as they know it, so that a player can see 
his or her hits and misses.  

●I want to present each player, on their turn, with a 
console print-out of his or her own board with updated hits and misses. 

●I want the game to keep track of which ships I have 
completely destroyed, so that I can keep score of who is winning
